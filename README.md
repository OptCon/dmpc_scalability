## A case study on large-scale distributed nonlinear model predictive control
Multi-threaded implementations of linear and nonlinear Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) via the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and decentralized Sequential Quadratic Programming (dSQP). 

If you use this code, we would appreciate you citing the accompanying [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05627).

## Instructions

To test centralized and decentralized solvers and to run closed-loop simulations, run the shell scripts in network_linear/ and network_nonlinear/. Note that the scripts may run for a few hours.
